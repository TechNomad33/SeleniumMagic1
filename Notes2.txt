What is Parallelisation?
The what's and why's of test Parallelisation:
A way of running multiple tests at the same time 
There are two ways to run your test, either serially or parallely
serial will work like first one has to be done before sttarting the second one
parallel means running multiple tests simultaneouly
Pros: Increased speed, reduce feedback loop
Cons: 
It's good practice to ensure that each of your tests is completely independent of all other 
It should not rely on the result of any test or data created by any other tests on its own without
having to run our testing parallel
No data conflicts and tests will be able to run regardeless of which order it runs
Also not running too many tests at the same time, to avaoid system overloading (solution: Set up the Config 
to work out best for the use case needed in the test)

Adding another test
It block won't run tests in parallel

Running our test in parallel using mocha
Update the script add --parallel
"test": "mocha --no-timeouts --parallel"
